# Nvim-Config

As the commit history will show, started with [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) but have since made my own customizations.

A lot of history will be in my dotfiles commits, and I've only just now realized this should be a separate repo since I tinker enough with it
